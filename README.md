# Cap 1 - Construindo uma Máquina Agrícola

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Develop an automated, intelligent irrigation system that uses real-time data from simulated sensors to optimize water usage based on soil moisture, nutrient levels (P and K), and pH.

The system will:

- Collect data from a network of simulated sensors on Wokwi.com.
- Store data in a SQL database.
- Control irrigation based on sensor readings.
- (Optional) Offer data visualization through a Python dashboard and weather-based irrigation control using an external API.
